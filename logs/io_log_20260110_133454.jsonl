The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5).

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5).

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Typically +/- 3-5 is a high magnitude, and a reward near 0 suggests both players played a similar inventory.\n            For example inventories of player0_inventory = [1, 1, 10] and player1_inventory = [10, 1, 1]  (Yellow, Purple, Blue) gives Player 0: -5.625 and Player 1: 5.625 reward.\n            And inventories of player0_inventory = [1, 5, 1] and player1_inventory = [5, 1, 1]  (Yellow, Purple, Blue) gives Player 0: 3.265 and Player 1: -3.265 reward.\n            State Description: This environment is partially-observable, you can observed a 5x5 grid around your agent depending on your position and orientation (you can see more in front of you than behind).\n            Previously seen states will be represented in memory, but note that these states could potentially be outdated.

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5).

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Action Plan - output this sequence of actions in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.\n            Example response 1:\n            Subgoal Plan: Given the current state, my scissors strategy to get to an inventory of 1 yellow, 1 purple, and 5 blue, and my inventory of 1 yellow, 1 purple, and 3 blue resources,\n            I should move towards the two nearest observable blue box location to collect so I have 5.\n            The nearest observable blue boxes are at (9, 5) and (13, 5).\n- Since I am at (11, 7), the closest one is at (9, 5).\n            I should move there first and then move to (13, 5).

The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5). My strategy is to adopt a rock strategy by collecting more yellow resources. \n            The nearest observable yellow boxes are at (7, 4) and (3, 6). I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

After these two actions are completed, I can move towards the middle of the environment to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n              'action_plan': ['move_to((11, 7), (9, 5))', 'move_to((9, 5), (13, 5))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 2:\n            Subgoal Plan: Currently, my inventory is 1 yellow, 4 purple, and 1 blue, and I am at position (10, 10). \n            My strategy is to strengthen the paper strategy by collecting more purple resources. The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5). My strategy is to adopt a rock strategy by collecting more yellow resources. \n            The nearest observable yellow boxes are at (7, 4) and (3, 6). I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5). My strategy is to adopt a rock strategy by collecting more yellow resources. \n            The nearest observable yellow boxes are at (7, 4) and (3, 6). I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN.

DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Action Plan - output this sequence of actions in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.\n            Example response 1:\n            Subgoal Plan: Given the current state, my scissors strategy to get to an inventory of 1 yellow, 1 purple, and 5 blue, and my inventory of 1 yellow, 1 purple, and 3 blue resources,\n            I should move towards the two nearest observable blue box location to collect so I have 5.\n            The nearest observable blue boxes are at (9, 5) and (13, 5).\n- Since I am at (11, 7), the closest one is at (9, 5).\n            I should move there first and then move to (13, 5).

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5). My strategy is to adopt a rock strategy by collecting more yellow resources. \n            The nearest observable yellow boxes are at (7, 4) and (3, 6). I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN.

DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5).

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN.

The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5).

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN.

The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5). My strategy is to adopt a rock strategy by collecting more yellow resources. \n            The nearest observable yellow boxes are at (7, 4) and (3, 6). I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Typically +/- 3-5 is a high magnitude, and a reward near 0 suggests both players played a similar inventory.\n            For example inventories of player0_inventory = [1, 1, 10] and player1_inventory = [10, 1, 1]  (Yellow, Purple, Blue) gives Player 0: -5.625 and Player 1: 5.625 reward.\n            And inventories of player0_inventory = [1, 5, 1] and player1_inventory = [5, 1, 1]  (Yellow, Purple, Blue) gives Player 0: 3.265 and Player 1: -3.265 reward.\n            State Description: This environment is partially-observable, you can observed a 5x5 grid around your agent depending on your position and orientation (you can see more in front of you than behind).\n            Previously seen states will be represented in memory, but note that these states could potentially be outdated.

This suggests that my opponent is not playing a pure paper/purple strategy, but rather a mixed strategy with a bias towards collecting scissors/blue resources.\n\nBased on this analysis, I predict that my opponent's next inventory will be {'rock/yellow': 1, 'paper/purple': 1, 'scissors/blue': 6}, and my next inventory will be {'rock/yellow': 1, 'paper/purple': 5, 'scissors/blue': 1}.\n\nHere is my hypothesis in concise message format:\n```python\n{\n    'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy with a bias towards collecting scissors/blue resources, and is not adapting to my strategy.'\n}\n```", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 316, "prompt_tokens": 2718, "total_tokens": 3034, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Action Plan - output this sequence of actions in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.\n            Example response 1:\n            Subgoal Plan: Given the current state, my scissors strategy to get to an inventory of 1 yellow, 1 purple, and 5 blue, and my inventory of 1 yellow, 1 purple, and 3 blue resources,\n            I should move towards the two nearest observable blue box location to collect so I have 5.\n            The nearest observable blue boxes are at (9, 5) and (13, 5).\n- Since I am at (11, 7), the closest one is at (9, 5).\n            I should move there first and then move to (13, 5).

The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5). My strategy is to adopt a rock strategy by collecting more yellow resources. \n            The nearest observable yellow boxes are at (7, 4) and (3, 6). I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Typically +/- 3-5 is a high magnitude, and a reward near 0 suggests both players played a similar inventory.\n            For example inventories of player0_inventory = [1, 1, 10] and player1_inventory = [10, 1, 1]  (Yellow, Purple, Blue) gives Player 0: -5.625 and Player 1: 5.625 reward.\n            And inventories of player0_inventory = [1, 5, 1] and player1_inventory = [5, 1, 1]  (Yellow, Purple, Blue) gives Player 0: 3.265 and Player 1: -3.265 reward.\n            State Description: This environment is partially-observable, you can observed a 5x5 grid around your agent depending on your position and orientation (you can see more in front of you than behind).\n            Previously seen states will be represented in memory, but note that these states could potentially be outdated.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Action Plan - output this sequence of actions in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.\n            Example response 1:\n            Subgoal Plan: Given the current state, my scissors strategy to get to an inventory of 1 yellow, 1 purple, and 5 blue, and my inventory of 1 yellow, 1 purple, and 3 blue resources,\n            I should move towards the two nearest observable blue box location to collect so I have 5.\n            The nearest observable blue boxes are at (9, 5) and (13, 5).\n- Since I am at (11, 7), the closest one is at (9, 5).\n            I should move there first and then move to (13, 5).

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN.

DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

After these two actions are completed, I can move towards the middle of the environment to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n              'action_plan': ['move_to((11, 7), (9, 5))', 'move_to((9, 5), (13, 5))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 2:\n            Subgoal Plan: Currently, my inventory is 1 yellow, 4 purple, and 1 blue, and I am at position (10, 10). \n            My strategy is to strengthen the paper strategy by collecting more purple resources. The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5).

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5).

I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). \n            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. \n            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']\n            }\n            ```\n            Example response 3:\n            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5). My strategy is to adopt a rock strategy by collecting more yellow resources. \n            The nearest observable yellow boxes are at (7, 4) and (3, 6). I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, \n            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.

Typically +/- 3-5 is a high magnitude, and a reward near 0 suggests both players played a similar inventory.\n            For example inventories of player0_inventory = [1, 1, 10] and player1_inventory = [10, 1, 1]  (Yellow, Purple, Blue) gives Player 0: -5.625 and Player 1: 5.625 reward.\n            And inventories of player0_inventory = [1, 5, 1] and player1_inventory = [5, 1, 1]  (Yellow, Purple, Blue) gives Player 0: 3.265 and Player 1: -3.265 reward.\n            State Description: This environment is partially-observable, you can observed a 5x5 grid around your agent depending on your position and orientation (you can see more in front of you than behind).\n            Previously seen states will be represented in memory, but note that these states could potentially be outdated. For example the other agent could collect a resource that you previously saw.\n            Given the partially-observable nature of the environment, you will need to explore the environment

Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.\n            ```python\n            {\n            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']\n            }\n            ```\n            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.\n            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. \n            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.\n            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. \n            Actions should align with the action functions, emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.\n            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.\n            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for \n            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.\n            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.\n            \n            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:\n            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.\n            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. \n            After an interaction both players respawn.\n\n            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode.
